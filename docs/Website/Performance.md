# Performance

## Understand How Your Systems Perform — Under Any Load

**Performance issues erode trust long before systems go down.**

Opticini Performance gives you deep visibility into how infrastructure, services, and applications behave in real time—so you can detect degradation early and optimize with confidence.

---

## What Performance Does

Opticini Performance continuously measures how efficiently your infrastructure and services operate across local, hybrid, and cloud environments.

Rather than isolated metrics, Performance provides contextual performance insight, connecting latency, throughput, and resource usage to real infrastructure and service behavior.

---

## What You Can Measure

### Infrastructure Performance

- CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- Disk and network I/O
- Resource saturation
- Capacity thresholds

### Service & Application Performance

- API and service latency
- Request throughput
- Error rates
- Queue depth and processing time
- Database query performance

---

## How It Works

### Continuous Performance Telemetry

Opticini Performance gathers metrics using:

- **Agent-based** host and process metrics
- Application and service probes
- Cloud-native performance APIs
- Synthetic and background checks

### Performance With Context

All performance data is enriched with:

- Asset ownership and environment
- Dependency relationships
- Recent configuration or deployment changes
- Health and availability signals

This turns raw metrics into actionable performance insight.

---

## Key Metrics & Outputs

- Response time (p50 / p95 / p99)
- Throughput and load trends
- Resource utilization patterns
- Saturation and bottleneck indicators
- Performance baselines
- Degradation and anomaly detection

## Why Performance Matters

| Without Performance Insight | With Opticini Performance |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Slow user experiences | Predictable performance |
| Guesswork optimization | Data-driven decisions |
| Late incident detection | Early degradation alerts |
| Overprovisioning | Efficient capacity planning |

## Performance Connects Across Opticini

Opticini Performance works in concert with:

- **Health** – distinguish slow vs unavailable systems
- **Change** – correlate deploys with regressions
- **Cost** – identify over- and under-utilized resources
- **Risk** – elevate chronic performance issues
- **Compliance** – support availability and reliability controls

---

## Who Uses Performance

- SRE & Platform Engineering
- DevOps Teams
- Application Engineering
- Database Administrators
- Engineering Leadership

---

## Outcome

Faster systems, fewer surprises, and performance you can rely on—at scale.
