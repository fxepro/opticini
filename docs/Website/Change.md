## Know What Changed — and Why It Matters

**Every outage, breach, or compliance failure starts with a change.**

Opticini Change gives you complete visibility into infrastructure, configuration, and deployment changes—so teams understand impact before issues escalate.

---

## What Change Does

Opticini Change continuously tracks who changed what, when, and where across your infrastructure and platforms.

Instead of scattered logs and manual timelines, Change provides a single, correlated change history, connected to health, security, and compliance signals.

---

## What You Can Track

### Infrastructure & Configuration Changes

- System and OS changes
- Configuration updates
- Network and firewall rule changes
- Cloud resource modifications

### Platform & Application Changes

- Deployments and releases
- Infrastructure-as-code updates
- CI/CD pipeline executions
- Version and schema changes

---

## How It Works

### Continuous Change Detection

Opticini Change detects:

- Real-time configuration deltas
- Deployment and pipeline events
- Cloud and identity modifications
- Infrastructure lifecycle events

### Change With Context

Every change is enriched with:

- Change author and source
- Affected assets and services
- Related incidents or alerts
- Security and compliance impact
- Estimated blast radius

This turns raw change logs into actionable change intelligence.

---

## Key Metrics & Outputs

- Complete change timeline
- Change frequency and volume
- High-risk change indicators
- Change-to-incident correlation
- Mean time to detect change impact
- Unauthorized change detection
