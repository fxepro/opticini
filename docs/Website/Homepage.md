# Opticini

**Complete Optics & Insight Into Your IT Infrastructure**

One platform for discovery, operations, security, compliance, cost, and risk—across local, hybrid, and cloud environments.

👉 **Know what you have. Know how it's performing. Know what's risky. Prove compliance. Reduce cost.**

---

## The Problem



Modern infrastructure is fragmented.

- Monitoring tools show performance
- Security tools show vulnerabilities
- Compliance tools collect evidence
- Finance tools track spend

**None of them talk to each other.**

Teams are left stitching together dashboards, exports, screenshots, and audits—while risk quietly grows.

---

## The Opticini Solution

Opticini unifies infrastructure visibility into a single, continuous insight plane.

Instead of dozens of disconnected tools, Opticini provides end-to-end optics across:

- On-premise infrastructure
- Cloud & hybrid environments
- Applications, APIs, identity, and networks

All mapped to health, security, compliance, cost, and risk—in real time.
