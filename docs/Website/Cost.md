# Cost

## Total Visibility Into Infrastructure Spend — Before It Becomes Waste

**Opticini Cost provides real-time and historical insight into infrastructure spending across local, hybrid, and cloud environments.** It connects usage, configuration, and performance data to actual cost impact—so finance, IT, and engineering make decisions from the same source of truth.

This is FinOps-grade visibility, built natively into infrastructure monitoring—not bolted on later.

## What Opticini Cost Does

Opticini Cost continuously tracks how infrastructure resources are consumed, allocated, and billed—then correlates that data with performance, health, change, and risk signals.

It answers:

- Where is our money going?
- What is underutilized or overprovisioned?
- Which teams, apps, or environments are driving cost increases?
- What changes caused a cost spike?

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Unified Cost Discovery

- On-prem infrastructure cost modeling (servers, storage, networking)
- Cloud cost ingestion (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Hybrid environment normalization
- Environment-based segmentation (prod, staging, dev, test)

### 2. Usage-Based Cost Attribution

- CPU, memory, disk, and network cost mapping
- Application-level cost attribution
- Service and workload tagging
- Team, project, and business-unit cost allocation

### 3. Waste & Optimization Detection

- Idle and underutilized resources
- Overprovisioned compute and storage
- Zombie services and orphaned assets
- Redundant environments and unused snapshots

### 4. Change-to-Cost Correlation

- Cost impact of deployments and config changes
- Spike detection tied to releases or scaling events
- Drift-driven cost increases
- Rollback validation (did cost normalize?)

### 5. Forecasting & Budget Guardrails

- Trend-based cost forecasting
- Budget thresholds and alerts
- Anomaly detection for unexpected spend
- What-if analysis for scaling decisions

---

## Key Metrics Tracked

- Cost per application / service
- Cost per environment (prod/dev/test)
- Cost per team or business unit
- Utilization vs. spend ratio
- Idle resource cost
- Month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter spend
- Cost anomalies and spikes
- Optimization opportunity value ($)

---

## Who It's For

- **Finance & FinOps teams** → budget control and forecasting
- **Platform & Infrastructure teams** → right-sizing and optimization
- **Engineering leaders** → cost-aware architecture decisions
- **Executives** → visibility into ROI and infrastructure efficiency

---

## Outcomes You Get

- Reduced infrastructure waste
- Predictable and explainable cloud bills
- Faster cost anomaly detection
- Shared visibility between IT, engineering, and finance
- Measurable savings tied to real actions

## How It Fits Into Opticini

Opticini Cost doesn't operate in isolation—it is directly powered by:

- **Discovery** → what exists
- **Health** → what's working
- **Performance** → what's being consumed
- **Configuration** → how it's set up
- **Change** → what was modified
- **Risk** → what could go wrong

This creates true cost intelligence, not just expense reporting.

## One-Line Value Proposition

Opticini Cost turns infrastructure usage into financial clarity—so every dollar spent is intentional, visible, and defensible.
