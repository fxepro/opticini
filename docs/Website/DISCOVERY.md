# Discovery

## Complete Visibility Into Your Infrastructure

**You can't manage, secure, or comply with what you can't see.**

Opticini Discovery provides a single, authoritative view of every asset across your local, hybrid, and cloud environments—automatically and continuously.

---

## What Discovery Does

Opticini Discovery continuously identifies and inventories infrastructure assets across your organization—without manual effort or outdated spreadsheets.

From physical servers to cloud services to APIs and identity systems, Discovery becomes your living source of truth.

---

## What You Can Discover

### Infrastructure Assets

- Physical servers
- Virtual machines
- Cloud instances
- Containers & Kubernetes clusters
- Databases & storage systems
- Network devices

### Platform & Application Assets

- Web applications
- APIs & microservices
- Load balancers & gateways
- CI/CD pipelines

### Identity & Access

## How It Works

### Agent-based or Agentless

Choose the approach that fits your environment:

- **Agent-based** for deep host visibility
- **Agentless** via cloud APIs, SSH, SNMP, and network probes

### Continuous Discovery

Discovery runs continuously—not as a one-time scan—so new assets, changes, and removals are always tracked.

---

## Key Metrics & Outputs

- Total assets by type
- Asset ownership & environment mapping
- Tagged vs untagged resources
- Orphaned or unmanaged assets
- Asset change history
- Infrastructure sprawl indicators
