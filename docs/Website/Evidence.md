# Evidence

## Prove Compliance—Automatically

**Audits fail when proof is missing, outdated, or incomplete.**

Opticini Evidence automates the collection, organization, and maintenance of audit-ready evidence—so proof is always current and available.

---

## What Evidence Does

Opticini Evidence continuously collects and organizes verifiable proof that compliance controls are operating effectively across your infrastructure and systems.

Instead of screenshots and spreadsheets, Evidence delivers structured, time-stamped, auditor-ready artifacts tied directly to real system state.

## What You Can Prove

### Automated Evidence Sources

- Infrastructure and system configurations
- Cloud service settings and snapshots
- Security and access controls
- Logging, monitoring, and backup status
- Vulnerability and posture reports

### Manual & Attested Evidence

- Policy documents
- Employee attestations
- Vendor attestations
- Exception approvals

## How It Works

### Always-On Evidence Collection

Opticini Evidence:

- Automatically pulls evidence from live systems
- Refreshes evidence on a defined cadence
- Tracks evidence freshness and expiration
- Versions all evidence for audit traceability

### Evidence With Context

Every evidence item is enriched with:

- Linked compliance controls
- Associated assets and systems
- Collection timestamp and validity window
- Responsible owners and reviewers

This ensures evidence is trustworthy, complete, and defensible.
