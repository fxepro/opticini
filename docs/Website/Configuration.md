# Configuration

## Prevent Drift. Enforce What "Good" Looks Like.

**Configuration drift is one of the leading causes of outages, security gaps, and audit failures.**

Opticini Configuration gives you continuous visibility into how systems are configured—and alerts you when they drift from approved baselines.

---

## What Configuration Does

Opticini Configuration continuously monitors infrastructure and platform settings to detect unauthorized, risky, or unintended configuration changes across local, hybrid, and cloud environments.

Instead of relying on static baselines, Configuration provides living configuration intelligence that evolves with your environment.

---

## What You Can Control

### System & Infrastructure Configuration

- OS and system settings
- Installed packages and services
- Firewall and network rules
- Storage and backup settings

### Cloud & Platform Configuration

- Cloud resource configurations
- IAM policies and role assignments
- Kubernetes manifests and policies
- Managed service settings

---

## How It Works

### Baseline & Drift Detection

Opticini Configuration:

- Captures known-good baselines
- Continuously compares live configurations
- Flags deviations in real time

Baselines can be:

- Policy-defined
- CIS-aligned
- Environment-specific
- Custom per team or workload

### Configuration With Context

All configuration changes are enriched with:

- Who made the change
- When it occurred
- Related deployments or incidents
- Security and compliance impact

---

## Key Metrics & Outputs

- Configuration drift events
- Baseline compliance percentage
- High-risk configuration changes
- Configuration change history
- Mean time to detect drift
- Remediation tracking

---

## Why Configuration Matters

| Without Configuration Control | With Opticini Configuration |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Silent misconfigurations | Immediate visibility |
| Untracked changes | Full accountability |
| Repeated incidents | Stable baselines |
| Audit surprises | Continuous compliance |

---

## Configuration Powers Other Insights

Opticini Configuration is a critical signal for:

- **Security** – prevent insecure settings
- **Compliance** – enforce technical controls
- **Change** – correlate config drift to incidents
- **Health** – avoid outages caused by misconfiguration
- **Risk** – elevate systemic configuration weaknesses

---

## Who Uses Configuration

- Platform Engineering
- Infrastructure Teams
- DevOps & SRE
- Security Teams
- Compliance & GRC

---

## Outcome

Stable, secure, and compliant systems—with full visibility into how they're configured.

---

## Take Control of Configuration

Stop drift before it becomes downtime or risk.
