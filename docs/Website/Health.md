# Health

## Know What's Up — and What's About to Go Down

**Availability is the foundation of trust.**

Opticini Health gives you continuous visibility into the operational health of your infrastructure, services, and platforms—so issues are detected early and downtime is minimized.

---

## What Health Does

Opticini Health continuously monitors the availability and operational status of your infrastructure and services across local, hybrid, and cloud environments.

Instead of isolated uptime checks, Health provides context-aware service health, tied directly to infrastructure, configuration, and change events.

---

## What You Can Monitor

### Infrastructure Health

- Physical servers & virtual machines
- Cloud instances & autoscaling groups
- Containers & Kubernetes nodes
- Storage systems & volumes
- Network devices & links

### Service & Platform Health

- Web applications
- APIs & microservices
- Databases
- Load balancers & gateways
- CI/CD runners & pipelines

---

## How It Works

### Continuous Health Signals

Health monitoring runs continuously using:

- **Agent-based** host metrics
- **Agentless** probes (ICMP, TCP, HTTP)
- Cloud service status APIs
- Service-level checks

### Context-Aware Monitoring

Health signals are enriched with:

- Asset ownership
- Environment (prod, staging, dev)
- Recent configuration or deployment changes
- Dependency relationships

This turns raw uptime into actionable insight.

## Key Metrics & Outputs

- Uptime & downtime tracking
- Service availability (%)
- Host and service health status
- Incident timelines
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to recover (MTTR)
- Health trend analysis

## Health Feeds the Entire Platform

Opticini Health is tightly integrated with:

- **Change** – correlate incidents with recent changes
- **Performance** – distinguish slow vs unavailable systems
- **Security** – detect outages caused by misconfigurations
- **Compliance** – prove availability controls
- **Risk** – elevate repeated failures as operational risk

---

## Who Uses Health

- IT Operations
- SRE & Platform Engineering
- DevOps Teams
- Incident Response Teams
- Engineering Leadership

---

## Outcome

Faster detection, quicker resolution, and greater confidence in system availability.
