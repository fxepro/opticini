# Security

## See Your Exposure Before Attackers Do

**Most breaches don't start with zero-days—they start with visibility gaps.**

Opticini Security provides continuous insight into your infrastructure's exposure, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities across local, hybrid, and cloud environments.

---

## What Security Does

Opticini Security continuously evaluates your infrastructure and services to identify attack surface exposure, security misconfigurations, and vulnerability risks.

Instead of point-in-time scans, Security delivers ongoing security posture awareness, tightly integrated with infrastructure, configuration, and change data.

---

## What You Can Secure

### Infrastructure & Network Exposure

- Open ports and services
- Publicly exposed systems
- Firewall and security group gaps
- Network access paths

### System & Platform Security

- OS and package vulnerabilities
- Container image vulnerabilities
- Weak TLS and encryption settings
- Logging and monitoring gaps

### Identity & Access Security

- MFA enforcement gaps
- Excessive privileges
- Orphaned or stale accounts
- Service account risk

---

## How It Works

### Continuous Security Signals

Opticini Security uses:

- **Agent-based** host and package inspection
- **Agentless** exposure and configuration checks
- Cloud security posture APIs
- Identity and access state analysis

### Security With Context

Security findings are enriched with:

- Asset criticality and ownership
- Environment (production vs non-production)
- Recent configuration or access changes
- Known dependencies and blast radius

This ensures teams focus on what actually matters.

---

## Key Metrics & Outputs

- Attack surface inventory
- Vulnerabilities by severity
- Public exposure indicators
- Misconfiguration findings
- Identity risk indicators
- Security posture score
- Time-to-remediate metrics

## Why Security Matters

| Without Continuous Security | With Opticini Security |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Blind attack surface | Full exposure visibility |
| Point-in-time scans | Continuous posture |
| Alert overload | Prioritized risk |
| Late breach detection | Early risk reduction |

---

## Security Feeds the Platform

Opticini Security directly strengthens:

- **Configuration** – detect insecure drift
- **Compliance** – enforce technical controls
- **Change** – identify risky changes immediately
- **Risk** – quantify and prioritize threats
- **Health** – prevent outages caused by misconfigurations

---

## Who Uses Security

- Security Operations (SecOps)
- Infrastructure Security
- Platform & Cloud Security Teams
- IT Operations
- Compliance & GRC

---

## Outcome

A smaller attack surface, faster remediation, and continuous security confidence.
