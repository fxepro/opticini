# Risk

## Continuous Awareness of What Could Break, Expose, or Cost You

**Opticini Risk provides a unified, real-time view of operational, security, compliance, and financial risk across local, hybrid, and cloud infrastructure.** Instead of siloed alerts and static assessments, Risk continuously evaluates how configuration, change, health, performance, and cost interact to create exposure.

This is living risk intelligence for modern infrastructure.

## What Opticini Risk Does

Opticini Risk continuously analyzes infrastructure signals to identify:

- Where failures are likely to occur
- Where security exposure is increasing
- Where compliance gaps are forming
- Where costs could spiral unexpectedly

It answers:

- What is most likely to fail next?
- What changes increased our risk posture?
- Which assets pose the highest business impact?
- Where should we act first?

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Unified Risk Scoring

- Asset-level risk scores (servers, services, apps)
- Environment-based risk aggregation (prod vs non-prod)
- Business impact weighting
- Normalized risk across infra types (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)

### 2. Operational Risk Detection

- Health degradation trends
- Capacity exhaustion risk
- Single points of failure
- Dependency chain fragility
- SLA and uptime risk modeling

### 3. Security Risk Visibility

- Exposure from misconfigurations
- Unpatched or vulnerable components
- Excessive permissions and access sprawl
- Public exposure risk (ports, endpoints, services)

### 4. Compliance & Policy Risk

- Drift from required compliance baselines
- Evidence gaps and audit readiness risk
- Policy violations over time
- Control degradation tracking

### 5. Change-Induced Risk Analysis

- Risk introduced by deployments and config changes
- High-risk changes without rollback paths
- Correlation between change velocity and incident probability
- Risk reduction validation after remediation

### 6. Financial & Cost Risk

- Runaway spend risk detection
- Budget threshold breach likelihood
- Cost exposure tied to performance or scaling issues
- Risk of waste accumulation over time

## Key Metrics Tracked

- Overall risk score (global, per environment)
- Asset and service risk ranking
- Risk trend direction (increasing / decreasing)
- Change-induced risk delta
- Security exposure count
- Compliance drift severity
- Cost risk indicators
- Incident likelihood signals

---

## Who It's For

- **SRE & Infrastructure teams** → proactive failure prevention
- **Security teams** → exposure prioritization
- **Compliance leaders** → audit readiness confidence
- **Engineering leadership** → risk-aware delivery
- **Executives** → business-level risk visibility

---

## Outcomes You Get

- Fewer outages and incidents
- Earlier detection of systemic weaknesses
- Clear prioritization of remediation efforts
- Reduced audit and compliance surprises
- Informed decision-making under change and growth

---

## How It Fits Into Opticini

Opticini Risk is the synthesis layer across the platform:

- **Discovery** → what exists
- **Health** → what's degrading
- **Performance** → what's stressed
- **Security** → what's exposed
- **Configuration** → what's misaligned
- **Compliance** → what's drifting
- **Change** → what was introduced
- **Cost** → what could escalate

Risk turns all of this into actionable insight.

## One-Line Value Proposition

Opticini Risk shows you where failure, exposure, or loss is most likely—before it becomes an incident.
