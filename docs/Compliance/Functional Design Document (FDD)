## Functional Design Document (FDD)

**Scope:** Compliance Module (6 Functional Apps)

- Aggregates control-level results into executive-level views
- Acts as the entry point into compliance

### Supported Frameworks (Initial)

- SOC 2 (Type I readiness)
- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA (Phase 2)
- AI Governance / AI Act readiness

### Tools & Integrations Needed

#### Internal

- Control library (shared with Controls app)
- Evidence engine (read-only)
- Reporting engine

#### External / Open Source

- OSCAL control catalogs (reference data)
- OpenControl-style mappings

### Remote Software / Agents Required

❌ **None** (Frameworks is metadata + aggregation only)

### Results Achieved

- Clear compliance applicability
- Executive-ready readiness scores
- Prioritization of remediation work
- Investor & auditor-friendly overview

## Cross-Cutting Functional Principles

### 1. Continuous Compliance

Compliance is always-on, not audit-driven.

### 2. Evidence-First Design

Controls are evaluated only through evidence.

### 3. Least Privilege

Remote access is read-only and optional.

### 4. AI-Native Compliance

AI usage is treated as a first-class compliance domain.
